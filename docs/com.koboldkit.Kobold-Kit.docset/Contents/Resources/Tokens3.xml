			<Abstract type="html">Behaviors add custom logic to a node.
Behaviors differ from actions in several ways:
- they are useful for any logic code that is hard or impossible to implement with (custom) actions, such as event processing
- they usually run indefinitely and can be paused by pausing the controller
- they may have a state (ivars)
- they may have a public interface (properties, methods)
- they can not be reversed</Abstract>

/** A simple and efficient array of CGPoint structs.

   The array is an allocated block of memory instead of boxing the CGPoint in NSValue objects. For most efficient use,
   set the array's capacity to hold the same number of points you're going to add. Otherwise buffer will grow as needed,
   allocating 50% more memory each time.

   Feature set is minimal, please request if you need something. For example there are deliberately no "insert point" or "remove point"
   methods because they're probably not going to be used (frequently). */
